Whooa!! I have a wings and I can fly.

"Because Grandisian's power is energy
manipulating, so I use my energy to create
these wings"

What's a plan Nova?

"Find Zerat fight him if he out of energy
I will separate him easily"

No no no, I don't want to hurt my friend's
body although he is in the evil alien control.

"It's not hurt I'm just use my power to separate
him from your friend's body"

"Zerat use most of his energy to create portal
from jail to this planet, so now he not have
much energy left"

"We will trick he to use the spare energy
for making barrier to defense my separate
power and I will break his possession"

"After that I will trapped him with my
energy and call the portal from my planet
to get him back for punishment"

Okay this plan is acceptable

"5 Kilometers forward we will
encountered him prepared your self
human"

That's him
